# The	attrgetter	and	methodcaller	comes	
# in	handy	when	the	elements	of	our	iterable

from	operator	import	attrgetter 
class	employee(object):

#	Now	let	us	populate	a	list	with	these	class	objects.

# As	you	can	see,	the	order	of
# 	the	insertion	has	been	preserved.	
# Now,	letâ€™s	use	attrgetter to	sort	
# the	list	with	the	age	field:
#	Print	the	records 
employee_records_sorted	=	sorted(employee_records,key=attrgetter('age'))
